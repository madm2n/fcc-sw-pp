## Simple vanilla js AMP style slider (carousel)

This was made to create simple vanilla JS carousel to reference in projects. To look at `js` implementation go to `js/carousel.js`.

Note that this was done for modern browsers and not targeted to support `ie11` in any way. So if you need it to work there keep that in mind.
